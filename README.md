# Oracle Data Guard Implementation Plan

## What This Document Is About
This plan explains how we will set up automatic backup protection for your Oracle database. If your main database server fails, a backup server will immediately take over - protecting your business from data loss and downtime.

---

## Executive Summary

**The Problem**: If your current database server fails, your business stops until it's fixed.

**Our Solution**: Create a second database server that stays perfectly synchronized with your main one. If the main server fails, the backup automatically takes over in less than 30 seconds.

**Your Benefit**: Your business keeps running even if hardware fails.
